The method then calls another method called `getData` passing in `constantEnumeration`, `stringBytes`, and `rxLength` as arguments.\n\nNext, a variable called `zeroPos` is declared and initialized to 0. A loop iterates through each element of `stringBytes` and checks if the value is equal to 0. If a zero value is found, the loop breaks. \n\nAfter the loop, a new String object called `s` is created using the `String(byte[])` constructor, passing in `stringBytes` as the argument. The `substring` method is then called on `s`, passing in 0 as the starting index and `zeroPos` as the ending index. The resulting substring is assigned to `s`.\n\nFinally, the method returns `s`, the substring of the byte array converted to a String."
